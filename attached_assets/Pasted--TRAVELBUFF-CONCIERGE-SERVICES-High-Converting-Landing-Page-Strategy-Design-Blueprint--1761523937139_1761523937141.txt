Questions? We Have Answers.
```

**FAQ Accordion:**

**🏥 Is medical tourism in Latin America safe?**
```
Yes, when properly coordinated. All medical facilities in our network are JCI-accredited 
(Joint Commission International), meaning they meet the same rigorous standards as top 
US hospitals. We personally vet every surgeon, facility, and provider. Additionally, we 
coordinate all post-procedure care and remain accessible throughout your recovery.
```

**💰 How much does your concierge service cost?**
```
Our service fees typically range from 15-25% of your total package value, depending on 
complexity. For medical tourism, this includes complete coordination (surgeon selection, 
appointments, lodging, transportation, translation, and recovery support). For romantic 
getaways and cultural immersion, it includes personalized itinerary design, bookings, and 
24/7 journey support. We provide transparent pricing in your proposal—no hidden fees.
```

**🗓️ How far in advance should I book?**
```
For medical tourism: 6-8 weeks minimum (allows for consultations, testing, and scheduling). 
For romantic getaways and cultural experiences: 4-6 weeks for optimal availability, though 
we can often accommodate shorter timelines. Business discovery trips: 8-12 weeks for best 
partnership access.
```

**🗣️ Do you really provide service in three languages?**
```
Absolutely. All consultations, itineraries, and support are available in English, Spanish, 
or French—whichever you prefer. This trilingual fluency extends to our partnerships: we 
negotiate directly with Latin American providers in Spanish, communicate with European 
travelers in French, and serve Caribbean clients in their preferred language.
```

**✈️ What if something goes wrong during my trip?**
```
We provide 24/7 WhatsApp support throughout your journey for immediate assistance with any 
issues, changes, or emergencies. For medical tourism specifically, we coordinate with 
facilities for any complications and arrange extended care if needed. Your safety and 
satisfaction are our absolute priority.
```

**🌍 Which destinations do you serve?**
```
Medical Tourism: Colombia (Medellín, Bogotá), Costa Rica (San José), Mexico (Guadalajara, 
Cancún). Romantic & Solo Travel: Europe (Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Santorini), Latin America 
(Cartagena, Buenos Aires, Costa Rica), select North American destinations. Caribbean Cultural
