# Supabase Configuration
# Get these values from your Supabase project settings:
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api

# Your Supabase project URL (found in Project Settings > API)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

# Your Supabase anon/public key (found in Project Settings > API > Project API keys)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Note: These must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the frontend
# The anon key is safe to expose publicly as it's protected by Row Level Security (RLS)

# For local development:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Fill in your Supabase credentials from the dashboard
# 3. The .env file is git-ignored and will not be committed

# For GitHub Pages deployment:
# Add these same values as GitHub Secrets in your repository settings:
# Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
